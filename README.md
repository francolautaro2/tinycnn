A small convolutional neural network built from scratch with numpy


The loss function is a constant, since I have not yet added backpropagation to tune the parameters of this network.


This small implementation is based on using the basic layers of a CNN, which are a convolutional layer, a max pooling layer, a flatten layer and a forward layer.
